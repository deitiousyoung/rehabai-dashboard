    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      At DY Rehab, we believe that healing is not just about recoveryâ€”it is about restoring confidence, 
      independence, and dignity. Our integrated approach to rehabilitation combines physical, occupational, 
      and therapeutic practices, ensuring that every patient receives care tailored to their unique needs. 
      We specialize in holistic therapies that address not only physical conditions but also emotional and 
      psychological wellbeing, recognizing that true recovery requires balance in all aspects of life. 
      With years of experience and a passion for patient-centered care, our mission is to guide individuals 
      through every step of their rehabilitation journey with compassion, professionalism, and innovation. 
      Whether through personalized therapy sessions, modern equipment, or community-centered wellness programs, 
      we are dedicated to helping patients regain mobility, strength, and a renewed sense of purpose. At DY Rehab, 
      every step forward is a victory, and every milestone is celebrated. Together, we build resilience, one 
      recovery at a time, inspiring hope and empowering lives.
