    <h2>Restoring Strength, Mobility & Hope</h2>
    <p>
      At <strong>DY Rehab</strong>, our mission is to provide holistic, patient-centered rehabilitation 
      services that restore not only physical function but also confidence, independence, 
      and quality of life. We believe that recovery is more than just healingâ€”itâ€™s about 
      rebuilding strength, regaining movement, and rediscovering the joy of living without limitations.  
      <br><br>
      Our team of highly skilled specialists offers a wide range of services, including physical 
      therapy to help patients regain strength and mobility, occupational therapy to promote 
      independence in daily living, and hand therapy to restore fine motor skills and dexterity. 
      For patients recovering from surgeries such as fractures, joint replacements, or sports 
      injuries, we provide comprehensive post-operative care tailored to individual needs.  
      <br><br>
      At DY Rehab, we embrace innovation, compassion, and dedication. Our facilities integrate 
      modern therapeutic techniques with personalized treatment plans, ensuring that each patientâ€™s 
      journey is unique and effective. We also focus on education, empowering patients with the 
      knowledge and tools to take control of their recovery beyond the clinic.  
      <br><br>
      With our strong commitment to excellence and care, DY Rehab is more than just a therapy centerâ€” 
      it is a community built on trust, resilience, and progress. Your journey to healing starts here, 
      and we walk with you every step of the way.
